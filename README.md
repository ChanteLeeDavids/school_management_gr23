Question 10
Because of the way the UML is built up, some entities must be completed before moving on to the next.
Some students may experience difficulties as a result of having to wait for someone else to finish their entity before they can begin working. 
This goes for the testing as well. Due to the fact that different entities may be built before moving to the next and error within a previous entity
ends up shutting down the project as a whole.
The need to wake for other members to complete their entities in order to provide basic functionality to your own is a hinderance as waiting consumes 
valuable time and if you do decide to carry on without the necessary entities you may unknowingly be producing flawed code.
